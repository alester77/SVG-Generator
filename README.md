# SVG-Generator

## Description

I created this program to take input from the user and create a simple logo based on those inputs. I created this project to practice with Object Orientated Programming and to practice with creating tests to run through jest.
I learned more about those topics and also learned more about structuring projects in a more professional way, especially when more and more files are needed. 

## Installation

To run my project, inquirer would need to be installed as well as jest to run the tests. 

## Usage

To use this SVG Logo generator you will run node index.js. Prompts will be provided and you will have to answer them completely to provide the information to create a a SVG Logo. You will choose text (up to 3 characters), text color, a shape, the shape color, and background color. Once completed you will get a message that says if the generation was successful or failed. Open the created file to see the text of the logo. Open with preview or Live Server to see it rendered. To run tests, run npm runt test in the console.

Thank you to my DU professor and TAs who provide excellent instruction and help to understand the materials. Thank you to MDN and W3Schools for easy to understand resources and the Xpert Learning instruction on the DU Boot camp spot to assist when I got stuck rendering the logo to Live Server.
